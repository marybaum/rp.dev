				<h2>I was afraid of the ball</h2>

The first day of tennis camp.

I was nine. And I couldn't make contact to save my life.

The pro figured out I was afraid &ndash; I had no clue.

He brought me to the net and very gently started tossing balls at my racquet face. 

I got over the fear. I learned I was hitting a shot that had a name: forehand volley.

By the end of that week, I could hit a forehand.

By the end of the following year's full summer, I could hit groundstrokes, volleys and lobs. It would be three more summers before I got a serve in. 

I didn't make my high-school team. I've never been in a tournament.

I <em>have</em> played on teams as an adult, and I love the discipline. I love the game.

My tennis story isn't about trophies and glory. 

It's about setting small goals and reaching them. And setting some more, and reaching those.

<h4>Which is also a pretty good way to grow a business.</h4>

Especially a tennis business.

The vast majority of the people we serve are not elite juniors with a bright future on the tour. 

They're regular people, like us, who look to tennis for fun and fitness, and for friends.

We don't have to grow a hundred times year over year, as if we were a hot startup in the tech capitals on the coasts. 

Our job is to serve our constituencies. Our players, our members, our customers, our students, our participants, our, well, whatever your organization calls the people you serve. 

If we serve them well, we'll have the luxury of growing predictably and raising prices regularly &ndash; widening profit margins and building operating surpluses to levels that will keep us going even if we have a bad year.

In my experience, a decent website can help in a whole lot of ways.
