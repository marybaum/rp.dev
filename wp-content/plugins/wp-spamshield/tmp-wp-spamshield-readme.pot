msgid "There are two layers of leading edge anti-spam protection that work together to <em>block both automated (spambots) and human spam</em>:"

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "The first anti-spam layer uses a dynamic combination of <em>JavaScript and cookies</em> to weed out the humans from spambots, preventing 100% of automated spam from ever getting to your site. Even if bot authors could engineer a way to break through the JavaScript/Cookies Anti-Spam Layer, the <em>Algorithmic Anti-Spam Layer</em> would still stop almost all of the spam that the JavaScript Layer blocks, and provides close to a fully redundant backstop. This JavaScript Anti-Spam Layer utilizes multiple randomly generated keys, and is algorithmically enhanced to ensure that spambots won't beat it. The powerful Algorithmic Anti-Spam Layer consists of over 100 advanced filters, and eliminates <em>trackback spam</em> and <em>most human spam as well</em>. And, it does all that without hindering legitimate comments, trackbacks, contact forms, or registrations."

Many other anti-spam plugins simply label a comment as spam, leaving you to sort through a spam queue, which wastes your valuable time. <strong>WP-SpamShield will give you back your time!</strong>"

msgid "If you want to improve the user-friendliness of your site, this is <em>THE</em> anti-spam plugin you want. After all, why should your users have to prove they are human? Since your users won't be inconvenienced by outdated and frustrating anti-spam methods, you will provide a smoother, trouble-free experience for your website users, which leads to improved readership, ad revenue, sales, or other types of conversion, and therefore greater success for your website."

msgid "Not allowing spam into the database improves security by potentially preventing SQL injection and XSS exploit attacks through automated spam comment submissions. The plugin also has several other features that improve security, such as blocking certain potentially dangerous URLs in spam comment submissions, and limiting comment size to 15kb. (15kb of text is roughly the equivalent of 3 typed pages in Microsoft Word, single-spaced, so that's more than enough for even the longest of comments.)

msgid "The plugin helps keep your WordPress database slimmer and more efficient (keeping your site running faster in the long term) by not allowing the thousands upon thousands of spam comments into it, which could bloat the database and potentially corrupt it. Keeping your database lean is extremely important, because bloated databases result in much longer query times and increased server load, slowing down a site dramatically even for simple functions. If website performance is important to you, then you definitely want an anti-spam plugin like WP-SpamShield instead of a plugin that uses a spam queue. See <a href=\"http://www.redsandmarketing.com/plugins/wp-spamshield/faqs/#faqs_15\">this FAQ</a> for more detailed info."

msgid "It does all this with <em>ZERO false positives</em>, because of <em>the method used to block spam</em>. Notice we didn't say a \"low false positive rate\" - we said <em>ZERO false positives</em>. If a comment/contact form/registration gets blocked as spam, the user is given instant feedback and has a chance to correct their comment/contact form/registration/etc and try again, which means there cannot be false positives. This leads to fewer frustrated website visitors, and less work for you. We are committed to keeping the promise of zero false positives."

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "The trackback validation contains a filter that compares the client IP address of the incoming trackback against the IP address of the server where the link is supposedly coming from. If they don't match, then it is guaranteed spam, without fail. This alone eliminates more than 99.99% of trackback spam. Trackback spammers don't send spam out from the same server where their clients' websites reside. There are algorithmic anti-spam filters in place to ensure 100% trackback spam blocking. Although it's far more rare, the plugin protects again pingback spam as well. You can be confident that only legitimate trackbacks and pingbacks will get through."

WP-SpamShield also includes automatic anti-spam protection for Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, Ninja Forms, JetPack Contact Forms, Fast Secure Contact Forms, Formidable Forms, and more. (You don't have to do a thing...just add your Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, Ninja Forms, JetPack Contact Forms, or other forms to your site, and they will automatically be protected.)

The plugin automatically obfuscates plain text email addresses and <code>mailto</code> links in your website content by encoding them into HTML entities (hexadecimal and decimal character codes that look like gibberish to harvesters, but render the email addresses perfectly in a browser). It protects email addresses on pages, posts, comments, excerpts, and text widgets."

msgid "The concept of using a CAPTCHA as an anti-spam solution in this modern day and age is flawed for several reasons:"
msgstr ""

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "This plugin has an extremely low overhead and won't slow down your site, unlike some other anti-spam plugins. Each of the filters in the plugin have been benchmarked, and when processing comments for spam, the fastest filters are put at the front of the stack. Once a comment tests positive for spam, the testing process terminates and will not engage the remaining filters. Additionally, as mentioned above, by keeping spam out of the WordPress database altogether, WP-SpamShield helps keep your database slimmer and more efficient, which in turn helps keep your site running faster. This efficiency helps keep the server load down, and helps improve the overall performance of your site. WP-SpamShield is optimized to work well with <em>all</em> major caching plugins."
msgstr ""

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "Speaking of scalability, WP-SpamShield can kill spam faster than any cloud-based anti-spam solution. Cloud-based anti-spam plugins are inherently slower at processing spam because they have to connect to an external server to check the spam status, which in turn <em>will increase your site's server load</em>. With WP-SpamShield, all anti-spam processing happens directly on your website's server, with lightning speed."
